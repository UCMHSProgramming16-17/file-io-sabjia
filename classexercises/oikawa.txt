i don't want them to go to different universities
honestly, i don't even think oikawa will be able to stand being more than two feet from iwaizumi
and iwaizumi is too protective and a worrywart sooooo
i want them both to go into the japan team together
but i don't think iwaizumi will want to join that team, i think he wants to be a doctor... i can imagine him as a doctor
